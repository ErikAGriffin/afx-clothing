      Notes.

      For me this was an exploration into some css animations, and eventually
      ngAnimate.  Looking back it is much easier to use angular-animate to
      create specialized animations than to use CSS trickery, and would have
      influenced the core structure of my html.

      In the end, I think the product boxes are too busy but I learned how
      much easier to get custom animations would have been if I had started with
      ngAnimate.

      There are also a few initial design choices I regret.

      The first is deciding that color is independent of productID,
      that is instead of a different UUID for every possible product,
      each name is unique and may have multiple colors.
      The second is mocking my data in an array instead of
      a hash with product id's as keys.

      The combination of these two flaws led to nested loops
      (O n^2) as well as the pain of having to constantly consider
      which to use color when dealing with objects.

      Another cause of some small headache was creating smaller child objects
      for the carts, instead of adding the actual original product object.
      I thought since the cart was to be stored in the session I should make the
      objects as small as possible, but now I believe this was just premature
      optimization.

      Otherwise I am very happy with the functionality I achieved.  I think its
      funny that I was initially so pleased with the square grid responsive design,
      but after implementing filtering I realized how strange it looked to have
      a large screen with only two items displayed.  This would have required
      a complete redesign so I just left it as is.
